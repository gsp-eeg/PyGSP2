"""Example of a graph signal for the Santiago Metro.

This example shows a graph signal defined over a graph induced by the Santiago
Metro (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Metro). Each station is a
node. Two nodes are connected if the corresponding stations are connected. The
data for each node is the daily average of people leaving each station.

To run this example, you need to download three files and place them in the
same directory as this script.

1. Download the file `Tablas de subidas y bajadas nov23.zip` from this link:

https://www.dtpm.cl/descargas/modelos_y_matrices/Tablas%20de%20subidas%20y%20bajadas%20nov23.zip

Then, uncompress the zip file and copy `2023.11 Matriz_baj_SS_MH.xlsb` to the
same location as this script.

2. Download the file `santiago_metro_stations_coords.geojson` from this link:

https://zenodo.org/records/11637462/files/santiago_metro_stations_coords.geojson

3. Download the file `santiago_metro_stations_connections.txt` from this link:

https://zenodo.org/records/11637462/files/santiago_metro_stations_connections.txt
