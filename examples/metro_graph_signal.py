"""Example of a graph signal for the Santiago Metro

This example shows a graph signal defined over a graph induced by the Santiago
Metro (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Metro). Each station is a
node. Two nodes are connected if the corresponding stations are connected. The
data for each node is the daily average of people leaving each station.

Download the file `Tablas de subidas y bajadas nov23.zip` from this link:

https://www.dtpm.cl/descargas/modelos_y_matrices/Tablas%20de%20subidas%20y%20bajadas%20nov23.zip

Then, uncompress the zip file and copy `2023.11 Matriz_baj_SS_MH.xlsb` to the
same location as this script.

An additional requirement is to have the file `metroCoords.geojson`
which was obtained from OpenStreetMap data, using the
service https://overpass-turbo.eu/, with the query

node
[public_transport=station]
[station=subway]
({{bbox}});
out;

Not that you need to have the city of Santiago in the map to use it as the
bounding box.

We can use this to get the lines, but is not clear at the moment how to
programatically get the stations that are connected:

[out:json][timeout:25];
// gather results
way["railway"="subway"]
["name"="LÃ­nea 5"]
({{bbox}});
// print results
out geom;
